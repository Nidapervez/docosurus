title: "Actuation and Control"
---

This chapter delves into the "muscles" of Physical AI. We'll examine different types of actuators and control systems that enable physical interaction with the world, from simple movements to complex manipulation tasks.

### Key Topics:

*   **Electric Motors**: The workhorses of robotics.
*   **Hydraulic and Pneumatic Systems**: Powering heavy-duty robots.
*   **Control Theory**: The mathematics of movement.
*   **Inverse Kinematics**: Calculating the joint movements required to reach a target.
