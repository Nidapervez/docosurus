title: "Motion Planning and Navigation"
---

This chapter explores how Physical AI systems plan their movements and navigate through complex environments. We will cover algorithms for pathfinding, obstacle avoidance, and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM).

### Key Topics:

*   **Pathfinding Algorithms**: A* and Dijkstra's algorithm.
*   **Obstacle Avoidance**: Staying safe in a dynamic world.
*   **SLAM**: Building maps and tracking location simultaneously.
*   **Autonomous Navigation**: From self-driving cars to planetary rovers.
