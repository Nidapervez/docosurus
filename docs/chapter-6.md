---

This chapter explores how robots can learn from experience. We will delve into reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and other machine learning techniques that enable robots to acquire new skills and adapt to new situations.

### Key Topics:

*   **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through trial and error.
*   **Imitation Learning**: Learning by observing humans.
*   **Transfer Learning**: Applying knowledge from one task to another.
*   **Evolutionary Robotics**: Using evolutionary algorithms to design and train robots.
