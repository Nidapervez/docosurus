title: "Sensing and Perception"
---

This chapter focuses on the sensory systems of Physical AI. We will explore various sensor modalities, including vision, touch, and hearing, and discuss the algorithms and techniques used to process sensory data into meaningful representations of the environment.

### Key Topics:

*   **Computer Vision**: The "eyes" of Physical AI.
*   **Tactile Sensing**: The sense of touch.
*   **Auditory Processing**: Enabling AI to hear and understand.
*   **Sensor Fusion**: Combining data from multiple sensors.
